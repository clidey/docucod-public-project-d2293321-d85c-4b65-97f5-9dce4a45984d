# Installing the SDK

Welcome to the Morphik Python SDK installation guide. This page walks you through the steps to install the Morphik Python SDK in your development environment, guiding you through compatibility notes and verification to ensure a smooth setup.

---

## Overview

The Morphik Python SDK provides a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use client for interacting with the Morphik API, enabling document ingestion, semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), knowledge graph creation, and more.

This SDK supports Python 3.8 and above and is compatible across common operating systems including Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Whether you are starting fresh or integrating into an existing project, this guide covers everything you need for a successful installation.

---

## Installation Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites:

- **Python version:** 3.8 or higher
- **Package Manager:** pip (comes with Python installations)
- **Internet access:** required to download packages from PyPI

Additionally, some optional dependencies like `pillow` are included for enhanced functionality such as image processing.

---

## Installing the Morphik SDK

You can install the Morphik Python SDK easily using pip, the Python package manager:

```bash
pip install morphik
```

This command downloads and installs the latest released version of the SDK from PyPI, along with all required dependencies including `httpx`, `pyjwt`, `pydantic`, and others.

### Notes for Different Environments

- **Virtual environments:** We strongly recommend installing the SDK inside a Python virtual environment (such as `venv` or `conda`) to avoid dependency conflicts.
- **Offline installs or locked environments:** Download package files (`.whl` or `.tar.gz`) from PyPI manually or use a private repository. Refer to PyPI documentation for offline installs.
- **PyPI versions:** The current stable release series is `0.2.x` (latest as of this guide is 0.2.9). For testing unreleased features, you may consider cloning from GitHub and installing locally.

---

## Verifying the Installation

After installation, verify that the Morphik SDK is installed correctly and ready to use:

### 1. Check the installed package version

Run the following command:

```bash
python -c "from morphik import __version__; print(__version__)"
```

Expected output: The installed version number, e.g., `0.2.9`

### 2. Run a Basic Import Test

Start a Python interpreter and try importing the module:

```python
>>> from morphik import Morphik
>>> db = Morphik()
>>> print(db)
```

No import errors means your installation succeeded.

### 3. Run the Example Script (Optional but Recommended)

The SDK includes an example usage script with synchronous and asynchronous demonstrations.

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the SDK test directory
cd sdks/python/morphik/tests

# Run synchronous example
python example_usage.py

# Run asynchronous example
python example_usage.py --run-async
```

This script performs:
- Document ingestion (text and files)
- Creating folders and user scopes
- Querying and retrieving data
- Listing and cleaning up documents

Successful execution confirms end-to-end functionality.

---

## Managing SDK Versions

Use pip to upgrade or downgrade as needed:

```bash
pip install --upgrade morphik

# or to install a specific version
pip install morphik==0.2.5
```

**Pro Tip:** Lock dependencies in your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to ensure consistent environments.

## Troubleshooting Installation Issues

Some common problems you might encounter and how to resolve them:

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Python Version Not Supported">

Make sure your Python interpreter is 3.8 or newer.

Run:

```bash
python --version
```

Upgrade Python if necessary.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission or Access Errors">

Try re-running pip with elevated permissions:

```bash
pip install --user morphik
```

Or use a virtual environment.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network or Proxy Errors">

Check your internet connectivity. If behind a proxy, configure environment variables like `HTTP_PROXY`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dependency Conflicts">

Conflicting package versions can cause errors.

Try installing within a fresh virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

## Where to Find SDK Releases

The Python Morphik SDK is hosted on PyPI:

- Package page: https://pypi.org/project/morphik/

Source code and releases are available at the official GitHub repository:

https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-core

You can browse releases, tags, and submit issues or feature requests there.

---

## Next Steps

Once installed, proceed to:

- [Authentication & Configuration](/sdks/getting-started/auth-config) to connect your Morphik client securely.
- [First Data Ingestion](/sdks/getting-started/first-ingestion) to start uploading and querying documents.
- Review [Synchronous vs Asynchronous Usage](/sdks/advanced-usage/sync-async-patterns) for integrating with your preferred programming model.

---

## Summary

Installing the Morphik Python SDK is fast and straightforward with pip. Make sure you meet the Python version requirement, use virtual environments, verify your installation, and consult troubleshooting resources if needed. With the SDK ready, you can seamlessly integrate powerful document ingestion and search capabilities into your applications.

If you encounter challenges, the Morphik community and detailed docs are available to support your journey.

## Example: Quick install and test

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv morphik-env
source morphik-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\morphik-env\Scripts\activate

# Install Morphik SDK
pip install morphik

# Verify installation
python -c "from morphik import Morphik; print(Morphik())"
```
