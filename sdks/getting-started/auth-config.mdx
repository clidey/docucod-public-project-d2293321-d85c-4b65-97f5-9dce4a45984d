# Authentication & Configuration

Securely configuring the Morphik SDKs is foundational to unlocking the platform’s full capabilities. This guide walks you through the authentication flows, how to configure your SDK clients with credentials, project URIs, or environment variables, and how to resolve common permissions issues.

## Understanding Morphik Authentication

Morphik uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to securely authenticate and authorize API requests. Each token contains metadata that identifies the user or developer, associated project or app, and permissions scope.

### Key Concepts

- **Entity Types**: The primary actors are either a `user` or a `developer`.
- **Entity ID**: A unique identifier (UUID or username) representing the authenticated entity.
- **App ID**: The project or application identifier (UUID) scoped to developers.
- **Permissions**: A set of permissions such as `read`, `write`, or `admin` that control access.

The authentication context, represented internally by the class `AuthContext`, holds these fields decoded from the JWT token, enabling fine-grained access control.

<CodeGroup>
```python
from core.models.auth import AuthContext, EntityType

class AuthContext(BaseModel):
    entity_type: EntityType
    entity_id: str  # uuid
    app_id: Optional[str] = None  # uuid, only for developers
    permissions: Set[str] = {"read"}
    user_id: Optional[str] = None  # ID of the user who owns the app/entity
```
</CodeGroup>

## Authentication Flows

### 1. Development Mode (Dev Shortcut)

Morphik supports a **dev_mode** which bypasses cryptographic checks for quick local development. When active, an `AuthContext` with permissive access is created automatically.

```python
if settings.dev_mode:
    return AuthContext(
        entity_type=EntityType(settings.dev_entity_type),
        entity_id=settings.dev_entity_id,
        permissions=set(settings.dev_permissions),
        user_id=settings.dev_entity_id,  # In dev mode, entity_id == user_id
    )
```

This mode is intended strictly for local usage to speed up prototyping and testing. **Never use dev_mode in production.**

### 2. JWT Token Verification (Production)

Tokens must be passed in the HTTP `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.

- The SDK or API server decodes the token using a shared secret key.
- It validates the token expiry and signature.
- On success, an `AuthContext` object is constructed from token claims.

If the token is missing, invalid, or expired, the server responds with `401 Unauthorized`.

### 3. Cloud and Local URI Tokens

Morphik supports specialized authenticated connection URIs:

- **Local URI**: For development, you can generate a Morphik URI embedding a temporary developer token signed with your JWT secret.
- **Cloud URI**: For hosted Morphik, authenticated connection URIs are issued per app and user with limited lifetimes.

These URIs contain the token credentials required by the SDK to authenticate

Example of generating a local URI with expiration:

```python
payload = {
    "type": "developer",
    "entity_id": name,
    "permissions": ["read", "write", "admin"],
    "exp": datetime.now(UTC) + timedelta(days=expiry_days),
}
token = jwt.encode(payload, settings.JWT_SECRET_KEY, algorithm=settings.JWT_ALGORITHM)
uri = f"morphik://{name}:{token}@{base_url}"
```

## Configuring the SDK for Authentication

### Using Connection URI

The simplest way to authenticate with Morphik SDKs is via a Morphik connection URI, which embeds the credentials:

```python
from morphik_sdk import MorphikClient

client = MorphikClient(connection_uri="morphik://user:token@host:port")
```

This URI format securely encapsulates the JWT token and endpoint.

### Environment Variables

Alternatively, you can configure authentication via environment variables:

- `MORPHIK_API_TOKEN`: Your JWT Bearer token
- `MORPHIK_API_URL`: The URL of your Morphik instance

Example:

```bash
export MORPHIK_API_TOKEN="<your-token>"
export MORPHIK_API_URL="https://api.morphik.ai"
```

The SDK automatically picks up these environment variables if they are set.

### Explicit Token and Endpoint Parameters

You may also specify token and API endpoint directly when initializing the client:

```python
client = MorphikClient(api_url="https://api.morphik.ai", api_token="<your-token>")
```

## Authentication in API Requests

All API requests must carry the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The SDK handles injection of this header automatically if configured.

When the server receives a request, it calls the `verify_token` dependency to:

- Decode and validate the token
- Extract and construct the `AuthContext`
- Apply scoping enhancements, like swapping databases or vector stores per app for enterprise setups

If token validation fails, the request is rejected with appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Managing Permissions

The authenticated token includes a **permissions** set controlling what the caller can perform. Common permissions:

- `read`: Can read documents, graphs, etc.
- `write`: Can modify or upload content
- `admin`: Full control including deletes and configuration

The API enforces these permissions rigorously.

### Troubleshooting Permissions Issues

- Ensure your token includes necessary permissions.
- Confirm that the token’s `app_id` matches the requested resources’ app scope.
- Developer tokens scoped to an app require both `app_id` and entity access.
- Use the `/usage/stats` endpoint to verify your permissions and usage.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **401 Unauthorized errors** usually mean:
  - Missing or malformed `Authorization` header.
  - Expired token.
  - Invalid token signature.

- **403 Forbidden errors** indicate insufficient permissions for the operation.

- **Token expiration** can be checked by decoding your JWT token payload.

- Use development mode only in local setups. Avoid exposing dev tokens in production.

        Server-->>SDK: 401 Unauthorized
    end
```

## Best Practices for Secure Configuration

- Always use tokens with the least privilege necessary.
- Do not share or commit tokens in source control.
- Regularly rotate your tokens and API keys.
- Use project-scoped tokens (`app_id`) when working with multiple apps.
- Use environment variables or secure vaults to store tokens.
- Validate your token’s expiration and permissions before making requests.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<Tip>
If you encounter authentication errors, verify that your JWT token is:
- Correctly formatted and signed
- Not expired
- Properly scoped with required permissions

Use JWT debugging tools like https://jwt.io to inspect token claims.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Never share your JWT secret key or private tokens.
Keep all credentials secure and rotate regularly.
</Warning>

<Note>
In enterprise deployments, tokens may route to app-specific databases or vector stores.
Always use tokens generated for your specific app/project scope.
</Note>

## Quick Example: Initialize SDK with Auth URI

```python
from morphik_sdk import MorphikClient

# Morphik URI embeds username and token
connection_uri = "morphik://developer:eyJhbGciOi...@api.morphik.ai:443"
client = MorphikClient(connection_uri=connection_uri)

# Use the client for API calls
response = client.query("What is Morphik?")
print(response.completion)
```

## Summary

Secure configuration and authentication is central to successful Morphik SDK usage. By leveraging JWT tokens embedded in URIs or environment variables, the SDK authenticates transparently, enabling secure and scoped access to projects and APIs. Keep tokens valid, scoped, and protected to avoid common pitfalls and ensure smooth operations.
