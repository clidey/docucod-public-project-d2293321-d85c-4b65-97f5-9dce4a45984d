# Authentication Overview

Understanding how to authenticate your requests to Morphik's API is crucial for securely accessing and interacting with your documents, knowledge graphs, and other powerful features. This page unpacks the essentials of Morphik’s JWT-based authentication system, instructing you how to obtain tokens, use them in API calls, and what to expect especially between development and production environments.

---

## 1. What is Morphik’s Authentication Mechanism?

Morphik uses **JWT (JSON Web Token)** authentication to securely identify and authorize users of the system. When you connect with Morphik, whether via the Python SDK, REST API, or Morphik Console, your requests carry an **authentication token** that proves your identity and your permitted access scope.

This token is embedded in a **connection URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier) that looks like:

```
morphik://<owner_id>:<auth_token>@<api_base_url>
```

- `<owner_id>`: The user or app owner identifier
- `<auth_token>`: The JWT token string
- `<api_base_url>`: The API hostname and port

The Morphik clients and SDKs extract and use this token for all authenticated requests.


## 2. Obtaining Your Auth Token

### Morphik Console & Hosted Service

When you sign up for Morphik's hosted platform, your auth token is part of the Morphik URI you receive in your account dashboard. Use this URI when initializing clients or SDKs.

### Development Environment

When running Morphik locally (for development or testing), a default URI usually points to `http://localhost:8000` and may allow development-mode autofilled tokens that are permissive for fast prototyping.

### Programmatic URI Generation

Morphik exposes API endpoints to generate auth URIs:

- `/local/generate_uri` for local dev tokens (valid typically for 30 days)
- `/cloud/generate_uri` for hosted tokens tied to your user/app ID

These endpoints require appropriate credentials, especially on cloud.


## 3. How Morphik Uses JWT Tokens

Each JWT token encodes claims about your identity, permissions, and expiry. The server verifies the token on each request:

- Valid signature using the server’s secret
- Token expiration (`exp` claim) check
- Permissions scoped per your role (developer, user, admin)

Tokens can carry additional metadata, such as associated app IDs for multitenant scoping.

### Development Mode

In development mode (`dev_mode` configuration), Morphik skips cryptographic verification and grants full permissions for convenience. This should never be used in production.


## 4. Sending Authenticated API Requests

When making API calls directly (without SDK), include the JWT token in an HTTP header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>
```

**Example using Curl:**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
  https://api.morphik.ai/retrieve/chunks \
  -d '{"query": "Your search query", "k": 4}'
```

**Important:** Always protect your tokens. Never share them publicly or embed them in client-side scripts.


## 5. Token Structure & Security Considerations

Morphik JWT tokens typically contain:

- `entity_id`: Your user or app identifier
- `entity_type`: The type of entity (developer, user, app)
- `permissions`: Access rights like `read`, `write`, `admin`
- `exp`: Expiration timestamp
- Optional `app_id`: Scoping your access to a specific application

These tokens enable Morphik to authorize actions like document ingestion, retrieval, agent queries, and more.


## 6. Development vs Production Differences

- **Development:**
  - Tokens may be fabricated without encryption
  - Auth verification is permissive
  - Base API URL defaults to `http://localhost:8000`

- **Production:**
  - Real JWT tokens must be securely generated
  - Token signature and expiry are enforced
  - API base URL typically points to your hosted Morphik endpoint


## 7. Example User Flow: Authenticating with the Python SDK

```python
from morphik import Morphik

# Your Morphik authentication URI from hosted account
morphik_uri = "morphik://owner123:eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...@api.morphik.ai"

# Initialize the client with authentication
client = Morphik(morphik_uri)

# Ingest a document while authenticated
doc = client.ingest_text("This is my confidential document.")

# Query with authenticated context
results = client.query("Find key points in the document.")
print(results.completion)
```


## 8. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Missing Authorization Header:** API calls without the auth header will be rejected with `401` status.
- **Expired Tokens:** Tokens have limited lifetimes; renew or generate new ones as needed.
- **Token Scope:** Using tokens linked to incorrect app IDs may cause permission errors.
- **Development Tokens:** Avoid deploying development mode tokens in production.


## 9. Troubleshooting Authentication Issues

- Verify your Morphik URI includes a valid token and correct base URL.
- Check the token expiration date inside your JWT.
- Use tools like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to decode and inspect your JWT.
- For cloud usage, ensure your user has appropriate permissions.
- If you see HTTP 401 errors, confirm your `Authorization` header is correctly formatted.

## Appendix: Technical Notes for Developers

The Morphik client extracts the auth token internally by parsing the connection URI. The token is then added as the Bearer token in the HTTP `Authorization` header for all REST requests.


### Token Extraction Example (React/JavaScript)

```javascript
import { extractTokenFromUri } from "@/lib/utils";

const morphikUri = "morphik://user:eyJhbGciOiJI...@api.morphik.ai";
const authToken = extractTokenFromUri(morphikUri);

// Use authToken as Bearer token in API calls
```


### Token Verification Server Side

On the server, Morphik uses a middleware to verify tokens for every protected endpoint:

- Validates the JWT against server secret
- Enforces expiration
- Extracts permissions and user/app context

If verification fails, a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` error is returned.
