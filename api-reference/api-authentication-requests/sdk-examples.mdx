# SDK Usage & Code Examples

Explore practical ways to utilize the Morphik Python SDK for common API operations such as authentication, document ingestion, querying, and workflow invocation. This page provides detailed, real-world code snippets and workflows to help you integrate Morphik’s powerful capabilities seamlessly into your applications.

---

## Getting Started with the Morphik Python SDK

The Morphik Python SDK offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients, enabling flexibility depending on your application's needs and environment.

### Installation

Install the SDK easily with pip:

```bash
pip install morphik
```

### Basic Initialization

```python
from morphik import Morphik

# Connect to Morphik server (default localhost:8000 for local)
db = Morphik("morphik://owner_id:token@api.morphik.ai")  # For production use

# For local development or testing
db = Morphik()  # Defaults to localhost:8000
```

<Tip>
Always securely manage your connection URI containing owner ID and token credentials, especially in production environments.
</Tip>

---

## Authentication & User Scoping

Morphik supports scoping your API operations by end user or folder for multi-tenant or application-specific isolation.

### Creating User Scopes

```python
# Create user context to scope operations to a specific end user
user_scope = db.signin("user@example.com")

# Use user_scope just like db for ingestion and queries
user_doc = user_scope.ingest_text(
    content="User-specific document content.",
    filename="user_doc.txt"
)
```

### Working Within Folders

```python
# Create or access a folder to organize documents
folder = db.create_folder(name="project_documents")

# Ingest directly into the folder
folder_doc = folder.ingest_text("Folder scoped content.", filename="folder_doc.txt")

# Create a user scoped to a folder
folder_user = folder.signin("user@example.com")
folder_user_doc = folder_user.ingest_text("Content from specific user in folder.")
```

---

## Document Ingestion

Morphik allows ingesting both plain text and files from disk, with metadata and optional advanced processing rules.

### Ingest Text Document

```python
text_doc = db.ingest_text(
    content="This is a sample text document.",
    filename="sample.txt",
    metadata={"category": "example", "author": "Morphik SDK"}
)
print(f"Ingested text document ID: {text_doc.external_id}")
```

### Ingest File from Disk

```python
file_doc = db.ingest_file(
    file="path/to/document.pdf",
    metadata={"category": "reports", "confidential": False}
)
print(f"Ingested file document ID: {file_doc.external_id}")
```

### Batch File Ingestion

You can ingest multiple files in parallel for efficiency:

```python
files = ["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf", "doc3.pdf"]
docs = db.ingest_files(files=files, metadata={"batch": "exp1"}, parallel=True)
print(f"Ingested {len(docs)} documents in batch.")
```

### Ingesting with Rules

Apply rules during ingestion to extract metadata or transform documents:

```python
from morphik.rules import MetadataExtractionRule, NaturalLanguageRule

rules = [
    MetadataExtractionRule(schema={"title": "string", "date": "string"}),
    NaturalLanguageRule(prompt="Summarize this document in one paragraph.")
]

doc = db.ingest_text("Document content to process.", rules=rules, metadata={"category": "rules"})
print(f"Document with processed metadata ID: {doc.external_id}")
```

---

## Document Queries

Retrieve and generate insights from your ingested documents using search and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

### Retrieving Chunks

```python
chunks = db.retrieve_chunks(query="Explain Morphik's purpose", filters={"category": "example"}, k=3)
for chunk in chunks:
    print(f"Score: {chunk.score}\nContent snippet: {chunk.content[:100]}...\n")
```

### Running Natural Language Queries with RAG

```python
response = db.query(
    query="Summarize the main points of these documents.",
    filters={"category": "example"},
    k=3,
    temperature=0.7
)
print("Completion:\n", response.completion)
print(f"Number of sources: {len(response.sources)}")
```

### Querying with Structured Output Schemas

Support structured output using Pydantic models or dictionary schemas.

**Using Pydantic schema:**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class SummarySchema(BaseModel):
    summary: str = Field(..., description="Summary of the text")
    key_points: list[str] = Field(..., description="List of key points")

response = db.query(
    query="Summarize this document and list key points.",
    schema=SummarySchema,
    filters={"category": "example"},
    k=1
)

print(response.completion['summary'])
print(response.completion['key_points'])
```

**Using dictionary JSON schema:**

```python
dict_schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "capital": {"type": "string"},
        "country": {"type": "string"}
    },
    "required": ["capital", "country"]
}

response = db.query(
    query="Extract capital and country.",
    schema=dict_schema,
    filters={"category": "example"},
    k=1
)
print(response.completion)
```

---

## Folder and User Scope Operations

Organize your documents and operations via folders and user-level scoping for isolated data contexts and access control.

### Folder Operations

```python
folder = db.create_folder(name="project_x", description="Documents related to Project X")
print(f"Created folder: {folder.name}")

folder_doc = folder.ingest_text("Document for the project.", filename="proj_doc.txt")
print(f"Ingested to folder: {folder_doc.external_id}")

docs_in_folder = folder.list_documents()
print(f"Documents in folder {folder.name}: {len(docs_in_folder)}")
```

### User Scope Within Folder

```python
folder_user = folder.signin("user@example.com")
user_doc = folder_user.ingest_text("User scoped document in folder.")
print(f"User scoped doc ID: {user_doc.external_id}")

folder_user_docs = folder_user.list_documents()
print(f"User documents in folder: {len(folder_user_docs)}")
```

---

## Async Client Usage

For asynchronous environments, Morphik provides `AsyncMorphik`.

```python
import asyncio
from morphik.async_ import AsyncMorphik

async def run():
    async with AsyncMorphik() as db:
        doc = await db.ingest_text(
            content="Async document content.",
            filename="async_doc.txt"
        )
        print(f"Async ingested doc ID: {doc.external_id}")

        response = await db.query("Summarize async docs.")
        print(f"Async query completion: {response.completion}")

asyncio.run(run())
```

---

## Practical Workflow Summary

1. **Initialize client** with proper Morphik URI or localhost for local.
2. **Ingest documents** via `ingest_text` or `ingest_file`, optionally with metadata and rules.
3. **Create folder or user scopes** to organize and isolate data.
4. **Query documents** by text or natural language with filters.
5. **Retrieve document chunks** to get relevant content fragments.
6. **Use structured output schemas** to extract structured insights.
7. **Clean up** by deleting test or temporary documents.

---

## Example: Synchronous Full Workflow

```python
from morphik import Morphik

# Initialize client
client = Morphik()

# Ingest a text document
text_doc = client.ingest_text(
    "This is an example document for Morphik SDK.",
    filename="example.txt",
    metadata={"source": "sdk_demo"}
)
print(f"Document ID: {text_doc.external_id}")

# Create a folder and ingest a document within it
folder = client.create_folder("sdk_demo_folder")
folder_doc = folder.ingest_text("Folder doc content", filename="folder_doc.txt")

# Create a user scope
user = client.signin("user@example.com")
user_doc = user.ingest_text("User scoped content.", filename="user_doc.txt")

# Retrieve chunks matching a query
chunks = client.retrieve_chunks("Morphik", filters={"source": "sdk_demo"}, k=2)

# Query using retrieval augmented generation
response = client.query(query="Summarize Morphik capabilities", filters={"source": "sdk_demo"}, k=2)
print(response.completion)

# Cleanup
client.delete_document(text_doc.external_id)
client.delete_document(folder_doc.external_id)
client.delete_document(user_doc.external_id)
client.close()
```

## Code Examples & Testing

The SDK repository includes example scripts and tests demonstrating both synchronous and asynchronous use cases with realistic data.

- **Example script:** `morphik/tests/example_usage.py` demonstrates a full synchronous and async lifecycle from ingestion to queries.
- **Test files:** Located under `morphik/tests/test_docs/` for ingestion validation.
- **Running tests:**

```bash
pytest morphik/tests/ -v
```

You can also run the example script standalone:

```bash
python morphik/tests/example_usage.py        # synchronous
python morphik/tests/example_usage.py --run-async # asynchronous
```

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Wait for documents to be processed** before querying results by polling `get_document_status` or implementing retries.
- **Use metadata filters** to target queries and retrievals accurately.
- **Organize data** using folders and users to isolate contexts and simplify operations.
- **Leverage rules** during ingestion to automate metadata extraction and document transformation.
- **Use structured schemas** with queries to get typed, validated output useful in downstream processing.
- **Clean up test or temporary documents** after your workflows to keep your Morphik instance tidy.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the Morphik server is running and accessible via the provided URI.
- Validate authentication tokens and their scopes, especially for production endpoints.
- Check document processing status and allow enough time before querying.
- For asynchronous usage, confirm proper event loop management.
- If encountering errors, review examples in the SDK repository and confirm your client version aligns with the server.
