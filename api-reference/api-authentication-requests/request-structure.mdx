# Request & Response Patterns

Understanding how to communicate effectively with Morphik's API is essential to successfully leveraging its powerful document and knowledge graph capabilities. This guide dives into the structure and conventions of the HTTP request and response formats, detailing required and optional parameters, content types, and strategies for error handling and debugging.

---

## 1. Overview of Request Format

Morphik's REST API endpoints adopt a consistent request format for JSON payloads and multipart form data where applicable. This consistency simplifies client development and ensures smooth integration.

### Content Types

- **JSON Requests:** Most endpoints accept and return data in application/json format.
- **Multipart Form Data:** Endpoints handling file uploads accept `multipart/form-data` containing files and JSON-encoded metadata/rules.

### Common Patterns

- **Request Bodies:** Sent as JSON objects with clearly defined fields.
- **Path Parameters:** Used for identifying resources (e.g., document IDs).
- **Query Parameters:** Used for filtering, pagination, and optional settings.

### Scoping Parameters

Many endpoints include optional parameters to scope operations by user or folder:
- `folder_name`: Single string or list of folder names to restrict the context.
- `end_user_id`: A string identifying the end-user context for multi-tenant isolation.

These parameters enable segmentation of data and queries according to organizational or user structures.

## 2. Request Parameters

Understanding request parameters is key to crafting precise API calls. Below are fields commonly found in Morphik API requests.

### Text Ingestion (`ingest_text`)
| Parameter    | Type                  | Required | Description                                                     |
|--------------|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `content`    | string                | Yes      | Text content to ingest                                           |
| `filename`   | string                | No       | Optional file name for the content                              |

### Batch Requests (`batch/documents`, `batch/chunks`)
- Send arrays of document IDs or chunk sources.
- Optional scoping parameters included.

### Graph Operations (`create_graph`, `update_graph`)
- Parameters include graph `name`, document filters, document lists, and optional prompt overrides.
- Scoping via folder and end user is supported.

## 3. Response Structure

Responses follow a consistent, structured pattern optimized for easy parsing.

### Common Response Types

- **Documents:** Represented with fields like `external_id`, `filename`, `metadata`, and ingestion status.
- **Chunks:** Include `content` (text or image), `score`, `document_id`, `chunk_number`, metadata, content type, and download URL if applicable.
- **Completions:** Text generated as answer or structured data according to schema; source documents included.
- **Graphs:** Detailed JSON describing entities, relationships, and metadata.
- **Batch Responses:** Arrays of documents or chunks with status information and error details if any.

### Streaming Responses

For streaming-enabled endpoints, events are sent as server-sent events (SSE) with:
- Data chunks tagged with `type: assistant` for partial completion text
- Final event tagged `type: done` with source information

### Example: Retrieval Chunk Response

```json
[
  {
    "document_id": "1234",
    "chunk_number": 1,
    "content": "Text content of chunk",
    "score": 0.95,
    "metadata": {"author": "John Doe"},
    "content_type": "text/plain",
    "filename": "file.pdf",
    "download_url": "https://..."
  },
  {
    "document_id": "1235",
    "chunk_number": 2,
    "content": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K...",
    "score": 0.89,
    "metadata": {"is_image": true},
    "content_type": "image/png",
    "filename": "image.png",
    "download_url": "https://..."
  }
]
```

*Note:* Image content is base64-encoded when transferred and automatically decoded into image objects in SDK clients.

## 4. Best Practices for Requests

### Parameter Usage
- Always provide the `query` string for retrieval and completion endpoints.
- Use `filters` judiciously to narrow down relevant documents or chunks.
- Adjust `k` and `min_score` to tune result quantity and quality.
- Use `use_colpali` flags when multimodal understanding is required for richer context.
- Employ `folder_name` and `end_user_id` for multi-tenant or organizational scoping to maintain data separation.
- Leverage `prompt_overrides` for fine-tuned control over knowledge graph extraction and generation prompts.
- When using `schema` for structured output, prefer Pydantic models or well-formed JSON schemas.

### Handling File Uploads
- Provide file names explicitly when ingesting raw bytes or file-like objects.
- Include metadata and rules in JSON-encoded fields alongside files.
- Use parallel flag for batch file ingestion when supported to improve throughput.

### Completion Queries
- Use `max_tokens` and `temperature` to control the completion length and creativity.
- Enable `stream_response` for improved front-end responsiveness and incremental display.
- Use `chat_id` to maintain conversation context across requests.
- Pass `llm_config` for advanced model-specific options, such as API keys or base URLs.

## 5. Error Handling and Debugging

### Common Error Codes
- **400 Bad Request:** Invalid parameters, malformed JSON, or schema errors.
- **401 Unauthorized:** Missing or invalid authentication token.
- **403 Forbidden:** Insufficient permissions, access to scoped data denied.
- **404 Not Found:** Requested resource (document, graph, chunk) does not exist.
- **429 Too Many Requests:** Rate limit or quota exceeded.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** Unexpected server errors; contact support if persistent.

### Debugging Tips
- Validate JSON syntax and content types before sending requests.
- Ensure authentication tokens are current and properly included.
- Verify folder and user scopes match access permissions.
- Use the request tracking and performance logs available in the SDK or server logs.
- For file ingestion issues, check file paths, names, and MIME types.

### Response Validation
- Check response status codes and parse error messages for details.
- For streaming responses, ensure the client correctly processes SSE streams.
- Confirm that structured output matches defined schema.

## 6. Practical Examples

### Example: Ingest Text Document
```bash
POST /ingest/text HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "content": "This is a sample document about AI.",
  "filename": "sample.txt",
  "metadata": {"category": "research"},
  "use_colpali": true,
  "folder_name": "research_docs",
  "end_user_id": "user123"
}
```

### Example: Retrieve Relevant Chunks
```bash
POST /retrieve/chunks HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "query": "Explain AI applications in healthcare.",
  "k": 5,
  "filters": {"category": "healthcare"},
  "min_score": 0.7,
  "use_colpali": true,
  "folder_name": "healthcare_docs"
}
```

### Example: Query with Structured Output Schema (Python SDK)
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class SummarySchema(BaseModel):
    summary: str = Field(..., description="Short summary")

response = morphik.query(
    query="Summarize the document.",
    filters={"category": "summary_test"},
    schema=SummarySchema,
    k=1
)
print(response.completion.summary)
```

### Example: Streaming Completion Response (Server-Sent Events)
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/event-stream

data: {"type": "assistant", "content": "Artificial intelligence "}

data: {"type": "assistant", "content": "is transforming healthcare..."}

data: {"type": "done", "sources": [{"document_id": "1234", "chunk_number": 1, "score": 0.95}]}

```

## 7. Progressive Workflow Example

When ingesting, querying, and working with the API, a typical user flow looks like this:

<Steps>
<Step title="Authenticate and Initialize Client">
Obtain your Morphik API token (URI) and initialize your HTTP client or SDK.
</Step>
<Step title="Ingest Documents">
Send files or text documents via the ingestion endpoints, optionally specifying metadata, rules, and scopes.
</Step>
<Step title="Wait for Processing">
Allow Morphik to parse, chunk, and embed your documents asynchronously.
</Step>
<Step title="Query Data">
Use retrieval or completion endpoints to search for relevant chunks or generate answers, refining results with filters, folder, and user scopes.
</Step>
<Step title="Handle Responses">
Parse returned document and chunk data or streaming completions as needed.
</Step>
<Step title="Iterate and Optimize">
Adjust parameters like `k`, `min_score`, `use_colpali`, and prompt overrides for best results.
</Step>
</Steps>
