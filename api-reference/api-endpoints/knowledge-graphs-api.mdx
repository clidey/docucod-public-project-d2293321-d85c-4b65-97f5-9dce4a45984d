# Knowledge Graphs API Reference

Unlock deeper insights and structured knowledge from your document collections using Morphik's Knowledge Graphs API. These endpoints empower you to create, update, and query knowledge graphs that represent entities and relationships extracted from your data. By turning unstructured content into connected graphs, you gain powerful semantic navigation, contextual querying, and visual exploration capabilities.

---

## Overview

Morphik's Knowledge Graphs API allows developers to build domain-specific graphs from ingested documents. Graphs consist of entities (nodes) and relationships (edges) that capture structured information hidden within your data. This page focuses on how to create these graphs, update them with new documents, and query the graphs to retrieve meaningful insights.

You will learn about:

- Input schemas for defining graph creation and updating
- Response formats for graph queries
- How to extract structured relationships using prompt overrides
- Example user workflows for building and using knowledge graphs

---

## Base URLs and Authentication

All endpoints are accessible through the Morphik API base URL with appropriate authorization. Typically, authentication uses bearer tokens attached in the `Authorization` header. Refer to the [Authentication Overview](https://morphik.ai/docs/api-reference/api-authentication-requests/auth-overview) for details.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Graph**: A named collection of entities and relationships extracted from a set of documents.
- **Entity**: A distinct object or concept identified in the text, labeled with a type (e.g., Dataset, Method, Task).
- **Relationship**: A typed connection between two entities representing a semantic link.
- **Document**: Source content ingested into Morphik from which entities and relations are extracted.
- **Prompt Overrides**: User-defined custom prompt templates and examples to tailor entity/relationship extraction to your domain.

## Creating a Knowledge Graph

Creating a knowledge graph involves specifying the documents to be used (via filters or explicit IDs) and optionally providing prompt overrides to guide entity and relationship extraction.

### Request Parameters

| Parameter         | Type                 | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`            | string               | Unique name for the knowledge graph to create.                                               |
| `filters`         | object (optional)    | Metadata filters to select documents, e.g., `{ "category": "research" }`.                |
| `documents`       | array of strings     | Explicit list of document IDs to include in the graph.                                       |
| `prompt_overrides`| object (optional)    | Customizations for entity extraction and resolution prompts, using `GraphPromptOverrides`.    |

### Example (Python SDK)

```python
from morphik import Morphik
from morphik.models import (EntityExtractionPromptOverride, EntityExtractionExample, GraphPromptOverrides)

# Initialize client
morphik = Morphik("morphik://owner_id:token@api.morphik.ai")

# Define custom entity examples
entity_examples = [
    EntityExtractionExample(label="AI", type="Concept"),
    EntityExtractionExample(label="Machine Learning", type="Method")
]

# Create prompt override
entity_override = EntityExtractionPromptOverride(examples=entity_examples)
graph_overrides = GraphPromptOverrides(entity_extraction=entity_override)

# Create graph
graph = morphik.create_graph(
    name="ai_research_graph",
    filters={"category": "research"},
    prompt_overrides=graph_overrides
)

print(f"Created graph: {graph.name} with {len(graph.entities)} entities")
```

### Outcome

Upon successful creation, the graph contains entities and relationships extracted from the specified documents. The creation process asynchronously invokes a backend extraction pipeline with your prompt overrides guiding entity and relation detection.

---

## Updating an Existing Graph

Add new documents or metadata filters to an existing graph to keep it current with fresh data.

### Request Parameters

| Parameter              | Type              | Description                                                        |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`                 | string            | The name of the existing graph to update.                         |
| `additional_filters`   | object (optional) | Additional metadata filters to select new documents.              |
| `additional_documents` | array (optional)  | Additional document IDs to include in the update.                 |
| `prompt_overrides`     | object (optional) | Optional prompt override customizations for this update run.       |

### Example (Python SDK)

```python
updated_graph = morphik.update_graph(
    name="ai_research_graph",
    additional_filters={"date": "2025-01-01+"},  # Documents from 2025 onward
    additional_documents=["doc123", "doc124"]
)

print(f"Updated graph now has {len(updated_graph.entities)} entities")
```

### Notes

- The update is incremental: new documents matching filters or listed explicitly are ingested and their information added to the graph.
- If no new documents are found, the graph's processing status is marked as completed without changes.

### Example: Entity Details

Retrieve details about a single entity:

```python
entity_info_json = await db.knowledge_graph_query(
    query_type="entity",
    start_nodes=["Convolutional Neural Network"],
    graph_name="scier_default"
)

entity_info = json.loads(entity_info_json)
print(f"Entity ID: {entity_info['id']}")
print(f"Type: {entity_info['type']}")
```

### Example: Find Paths Between Entities

```python
path_result_json = await db.knowledge_graph_query(
    query_type="path",
    start_nodes=["BERT", "Machine Translation"],
    max_depth=2,
    graph_name="scier_default"
)

paths = json.loads(path_result_json)["paths"]
for p in paths:
    print(" -> ".join(p))
```

### Example: List Entities Similar to a Term

```python
similar_entities_json = await db.knowledge_graph_query(
    query_type="list_entities",
    start_nodes=["Dataset"],
    graph_name="scier_default"
)

entities = json.loads(similar_entities_json)
for ent in entities:
    print(f"{ent['label']} ({ent['type']}) - Score: {ent['similarity_score']}")
```

## Prompt Overrides for Domain-Specific Graph Extraction

Customize graph extraction by providing examples and instructions, tailoring entity and relationship recognition to your domain.

### Entity Extraction Override

Define specific entity types and examples to improve recognition accuracy.

```python
from morphik.models import EntityExtractionPromptOverride, EntityExtractionExample

entity_override = EntityExtractionPromptOverride(
    prompt_template="Your task is to extract entities and relationships",
    examples=[
        EntityExtractionExample(label="ImageNet", type="Dataset"),
        EntityExtractionExample(label="BERT", type="Method"),
        EntityExtractionExample(label="Named Entity Recognition", type="Task")
    ]
)
```

### Using Prompt Overrides in Graph Creation

```python
graph_overrides = GraphPromptOverrides(entity_extraction=entity_override)
graph = morphik.create_graph(
    name="custom_scientific_graph",
    filters={"field": "computer_vision"},
    prompt_overrides=graph_overrides
)
```

> Prompts help tune the extraction process for better precision and recall in your domain.

## Client SDK Example Workflow

### 1. Ingest Documents

```python
from morphik import Morphik

db = Morphik("morphik://owner_id:token@api.morphik.ai")
doc = db.ingest_text("Neural networks are transformative.", metadata={"domain": "AI"})
print(f"Ingested document with ID: {doc.external_id}")
```

### 2. Create Knowledge Graph

```python
graph = db.create_graph(name="ai_graph", filters={"domain": "AI"})
print(f"Created graph: {graph.name} with {len(graph.entities)} entities")
```

### 3. Query the Graph

```python
response = db.query(
    query="What methods are used for image classification?",
    graph_name="ai_graph",
    hop_depth=2
)

print(response.completion)
```

### 4. Update the Graph with New Documents

```python
updated_graph = db.update_graph(
    name="ai_graph",
    additional_documents=["new_doc_id"]
)
print(f"Graph updated. Total entities: {len(updated_graph.entities)}")
```

---

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- **No documents found when creating/updating graph:** Verify filters or document IDs are correct and documents exist.
- **Graph query returns empty or errors:** Confirm the graph exists and `start_nodes` are valid entity IDs or labels.
- **Prompt overrides not reflected:** Ensure your overrides are properly formed and passed during the graph creation call.
- **Performance:** Use filters to scope documents to reduce processing time.
- **Versioning:** Keep prompt overrides updated to improve extraction quality over time.
