# Workflows & Rules API Reference

Manage and orchestrate rules-based and analytic workflows that process your ingested documents with precision and automation. The Workflows & Rules API offers endpoints to define, control, and monitor multi-step workflows that trigger extraction, classification, transformation, and other rule-driven processing on your documents. This reference covers how to create workflows, run them on documents asynchronously, track execution status, and understand the lifecycle of workflow runs.

---

## 1. Overview

Workflows in Morphik enable automation of document analysis using definable sequences of actions called steps. Each workflow is a named sequence of configured actions orchestrated to extract metadata, classify content, or perform transformations. You can create and manage workflows programmatically and trigger them on specific documents.

### Key concepts:
- **Workflow:** A named multi-step process consisting of one or more actions.
- **Action:** A single step in a workflow, identified by an `action_id` and parameters.
- **Workflow Run:** A concrete execution of a Workflow against a specific document.
- **Run Status:** `queued`, `running`, `completed`, or `failed`.

Workflows run asynchronously to keep your applications responsive; they queue jobs and execute in background tasks.

---

## 2. Authentication

All Workflows & Rules endpoints require authentication using a valid bearer token with permissions scoped appropriately. Your token must include `read` and `write` permissions to create, update, or delete workflows, and `read` permission for listing or querying them.

Unauthorized requests return HTTP 401 errors; insufficient permissions result in HTTP 403 errors.

## 3. Workflow Management Endpoints

### 3.1 Create a New Workflow

- **Method:** `POST`
- **URL:** `/workflows`
- **Description:** Define a new workflow by supplying its name, optional description, owner, and ordered list of action steps.

#### Request Body Fields
- `name` (string, required): Workflow name.
- `description` (string, optional): Description of the workflow.
- `owner_id` (string, required): Organization or developer ID.
- `user_id` (string, optional): End-user ID for scoped workflows.
- `app_id` (string, optional): Application ID if within app context.
- `steps` (array of object, required): Ordered list of action steps.
  - Each step:
    - `action_id` (string, required): Identifier of the action.
    - `parameters` (object, optional): Parameters specific to this action.

#### Response
- Returns the created workflow object with system metadata including creation timestamps.

#### Errors

    {
      "action_id": "morphik.actions.redact_pii",
      "parameters": {"redact_level": "strict"}
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3.2 List Workflows

#### Response
- Array of workflow objects.

### 3.3 Get a Specific Workflow

- **Method:** `GET`
- **URL:** `/workflows/{workflow_id}`
- **Description:** Retrieve detailed information about a single workflow by its ID.

#### Errors
- 404 Not Found if workflow does not exist or is not accessible.

---

## 4. Workflow Execution Endpoints

Workflows are executed against specific documents using asynchronous runs.

### 4.1 Queue a Workflow Run

- **Method:** `POST`
- **URL:** `/workflows/{workflow_id}/run/{document_id}`
- **Description:** Schedule a run of the specified workflow on the given document. Returns immediately with a `WorkflowRun` object in `queued` state.

This endpoints schedules the workflow execution in the background so the client receives quick feedback and the UI can reflect a "processing" status.

#### Response
- `WorkflowRun` object with properties:
  - `id`: Run ID
  - `workflow_id`: Workflow reference
  - `document_id`: Document being processed
  - `status`: One of `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`
  - `started_at`, `completed_at`: timestamps when run starts/completes
  - `results_per_step`: Array storing results of individual steps (initially empty)
  - `final_output`: The output of the last step
  - `error`: Optional error message if run failed

#### Errors
- 403 Forbidden if permissions insufficient.
- 404 Not Found if workflow or document does not exist.

### 4.2 Get Workflow Run Details

- **Method:** `GET`
- **URL:** `/workflows/runs/{run_id}`
- **Description:** Fetch detailed status and results of a workflow run identified by run ID.

#### Response
- `WorkflowRun` object with current status and outputs.

#### Errors
- 404 Not Found if run does not exist or access denied.

### 4.3 List All Runs for a Workflow

- **Method:** `GET`
- **URL:** `/workflows/{workflow_id}/runs`
- **Description:** List all execution runs for a specific workflow.

#### Response
- Array of `WorkflowRun` objects.

### 4.4 Delete a Workflow Run

- **Method:** `DELETE`
- **URL:** `/workflows/runs/{run_id}`
- **Description:** Delete a specific workflow run.

#### Response
- JSON confirmation message.

#### Errors
- 403 Forbidden if insufficient permissions.
- 404 Not Found if run not found.

## 5. Workflow Lifecycle and Execution Flow

Morphik’s workflow execution follows this lifecycle:

1. **Creation** — Define a workflow with specific ordered actions.
2. **Queue Run** — When triggered for a document, a run is queued with status `queued`.
3. **Execution** — The system sets the run status to `running`, executes each step sequentially.
4. **Result Gathering** — Each step produces output collected in the run’s `results_per_step`.
5. **Completion** — On success, the run status changes to `completed`; document status updates.
6. **Failure** — On errors or timeouts (~5 minutes maximum), the run status becomes `failed`.

This approach guarantees non-blocking operation for user interfaces and API clients.

---

## 6. Understanding Workflow Steps (Actions)

Each workflow step corresponds to an **Action** implementation registered within Morphik. Actions perform discrete processing tasks such as:
- Extracting structured metadata
- Running classification rules
- Transforming documents
- Calling external services

### Action Identification
Each step is defined with an `action_id` corresponding to a known action in Morphik's action registry.

### Parameters
Steps accept a JSON-serializable `parameters` object to customize action behavior. Check your configured action’s schema for supported parameters.

### Available Actions
You can list available actions programmatically via the internal registry or by exploring the Morphik GitHub code at [Morphik-Core workflows/actions](https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-core/tree/main/core/workflows/actions).

---

## 7. Practical Usage Example

Imagine you want to set up a workflow that automatically extracts structured metadata and redacts sensitive information whenever a document is ingested.

1. **Create Workflow** with two steps:
   - Action A: `morphik.actions.extract_structured` with schema parameters
   - Action B: `morphik.actions.redact_sensitive` with redact level "medium"

2. **Trigger Execution** using `/workflows/{id}/run/{document_id}` when a document finishes ingestion.

3. **Monitor the run** via `/workflows/runs/{run_id}` to check progress and outputs.

4. **Fetch results** from the `final_output` to verify completion or access extracted metadata.

---

## 8. Best Practices & Tips

- **Define clear, focused workflows:** Compose workflows from smaller, reusable actions for maintainability.
- **Use consistent owner and user scoping:** Attach `owner_id` and `user_id` to ensure correct visibility and access.
- **Handle run statuses in your UI:** Track run status transitions (`queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`) to inform your users.
- **Set reasonable timeouts:** The system defaults to 5 minutes per workflow run to prevent runaway executions.
- **Check permissions carefully:** Workflows require `write` permission for creation and updates; listing requires `read`.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Workflow Run stuck in queued:** Ensure background task handling is enabled and operational.
- **Run fails quickly:** Check if the target document has a processing `failed` status; workflows only run on successfully processed documents.
- **Action not found:** Verify the `action_id` matches registered actions exactly.
- **Permission denied:** Confirm your token includes required scopes.

### Tips
- Use the `/workflows/{id}` endpoint to verify workflow configuration.
- Query `/workflows/{workflow_id}/runs` to see past executions and error messages.
- Consult Morphik Core repository `core.workflows.actions` for available actions and parameters.
