# Signing Up for Morphik (Hosted Service)

Welcome to Morphikâ€™s hosted platform! This guide will walk you through signing up for a free Morphik account, accessing the Morphik Console, and locating your API credentials so you can start ingesting and querying data right away.

---

## 1. Create Your Free Morphik Account

Getting started with Morphikâ€™s hosted service takes just a few minutes.

### Steps:

1. Open your web browser and go to the Morphik sign-up page:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://www.morphik.ai/signup](https://www.morphik.ai/signup)

2. Fill in the registration form with your:
   - **Email address**
   - **Full name**
   - **Password** (choose a strong password)

3. Review the terms and privacy policy, then submit the form.

4. Check your email inbox for a verification message from Morphik.

5. Click the verification link in your email to activate your account.

<Tip>
If you don't see the verification email within a few minutes, check your spam or junk folder.
</Tip>

## 2. Accessing the Morphik Console

After you activate your account, the Morphik Console gives you a user-friendly web interface to manage your data, ingest documents, and run queries.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to the Morphik Console at:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://console.morphik.ai](https://console.morphik.ai)

2. Log in using your registered email and password.

3. Upon login, youâ€™ll see your dashboard showing your projects, ingested documents, and usage stats.

<Note>
The Console simplifies managing your data without writing code. It's perfect for exploring Morphikâ€™s features quickly.

## 3. Locating Your API Credentials

To integrate Morphikâ€™s powerful API or Python SDK with your applications, you need your **Morphik URI** â€” a secure token-based endpoint that authenticates your requests.

### Steps:

1. In the Morphik Console, click on your user profile icon (top-right corner).

2. Select **API Settings** or **Developer Settings** from the dropdown menu.

3. Here you will find your Morphik URI, which looks like:

   ```plaintext
   morphik://<app_name>:<token>@api.morphik.ai
   ```

4. You can copy this URI and use it directly to authenticate calls to Morphikâ€™s API or SDK.

<Tip>
Keep your Morphik URI private â€“ it contains authentication tokens granting access to your data.
</Tip>

## 4. Start Using Morphik with Your API Credentials

With your Morphik URI in hand, you can immediately begin ingesting documents and running queries.

### Using the Python SDK (Example):

Install the SDK if you havenâ€™t already:

```bash
pip install morphik
```

Then run this sample code to try ingesting a file and querying it:

```python
from morphik import Morphik

# Replace <your-morphik-uri> with the URI from your console
morphik = Morphik("<your-morphik-uri>")

# Ingest a document (local file path)
morphik.ingest_file("./docs/sample.pdf")

# Query the content
response = morphik.query("What is the main topic of the document?")
print(response.completion)
```

This quick example verifies that your account is active, the API token works, and your environment is ready.

<Note>
Refer to the [Morphik Python SDK guide](/sdks/getting-started/install-sdk) for detailed SDK usage instructions.
</Note>

## 5. Best Practices and Tips

- **Email Verification:** Always verify your email before accessing the console or API.
- **Secure Your Token:** Treat your Morphik URI as a secret. Avoid sharing or committing it to public code repositories.
- **Upgrade Options:** The free tier is generous, but you can upgrade later to unlock higher limits and additional features.
- **Explore the Console:** Use the console to upload, organize, and preview your documents before automating with code.
