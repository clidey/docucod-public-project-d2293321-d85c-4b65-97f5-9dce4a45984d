# Installing Morphik Python SDK

This guide walks you through installing the Morphik Python SDK using `pip` and verifying that it is ready for use. Whether you are starting development of programmatic integrations or building applications leveraging Morphikâ€™s powerful capabilities, this page provides clear, step-by-step instructions to get your Python environment configured and the SDK operational.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing the SDK, ensure your environment meets these minimum requirements:

- **Python Version**: 3.8 or later (Python 3.10+ recommended for best compatibility)
- **Operating System**: Any OS that supports Python 3.8+, including Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Network Access**: Ability to reach the Morphik API endpoint you plan to use
- **Package Manager**: `pip` should be installed and up-to-date

Check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

Upgrade pip to the latest version to avoid installation issues:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

## 2. Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Install the Morphik SDK Using pip

The Morphik Python SDK is published on PyPI and can be installed directly:

```bash
pip install morphik
```

This command downloads and installs the latest stable version of the Morphik client library and its dependencies.

### Step 2: Verify Installation

After installation, confirm the SDK is installed correctly by checking the installed package:

```bash
pip show morphik
```

Expected output will show package name, version, location, and dependencies, confirming a successful install.

Alternatively, test importing the SDK in a Python shell:

```python
>>> from morphik import Morphik
>>> print(Morphik.__version__)
```

This confirms the package is recognized and accessible in your Python environment.

<Check>
If you encounter errors during installation, ensure your Python and pip versions meet requirements and that you have network connectivity to PyPI.
</Check>

## 3. Basic Usage Verification

To quickly validate your Morphik Python SDK installation and connection, follow this brief example.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

You need to have a valid Morphik URI. If you are onboarding with the hosted service, obtain your Morphik API token as described in the [Signing Up for Morphik](https://morphik.ai/docs/getting-started/install-configure-morphik/cloud-signup) guide.

Set an environment variable `MORPHIK_URI` with your API URI or connection string:

```bash
export MORPHIK_URI="morphik://owner_id:token@api.morphik.ai"
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:MORPHIK_URI="morphik://owner_id:token@api.morphik.ai"
```

### Step 2: Run a Minimal Python Script

Create a simple script named `test_morphik_sdk.py`:

```python
import os
from morphik import Morphik

# Initialize Morphik client using environment variable
morphik_uri = os.getenv("MORPHIK_URI")
db = Morphik(morphik_uri)

# Ingest a sample text document
text_doc = db.ingest_text(
    content="Morphik Python SDK installation verification.",
    metadata={"category": "test", "source": "installation"}
)
print(f"Successfully ingested document with ID: {text_doc.external_id}")

# Perform a simple query
response = db.query("What is Morphik?", k=1)
print("Query response:", response.completion)
```

Run this script:

```bash
python test_morphik_sdk.py
```

#### Expected Outcome:
- Document ingestion will confirm by printing the document ID.
- The query will return a concise completion related to Morphik.

This simple script validates both ingestion and querying capabilities via the SDK, confirming that your installation and configuration are functional.

<Note>
Replace `MORPHIK_URI` with your actual Morphik URI/token before running the script.
</Note>

## 4. Additional Installation Tips & Best Practices

- Use a Python virtual environment to isolate Morphik SDK dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv morphik-env
source morphik-env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
morphik-env\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

- Regularly check for SDK updates:

```bash
pip install --upgrade morphik
```

- If using in production, pin your SDK version in your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to ensure stable builds.

- For asynchronous applications, install the SDK and use `AsyncMorphik` client as described in the [Morphik Python SDK README](https://morphik.ai/docs/sdks/python/README.md).

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Issue: pip command not found">
You may not have `pip` installed or it's not in your system PATH.

**Solution:**
- Install pip by downloading [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and running:

  ```bash
  python get-pip.py
  ```
- Ensure Python and pip are properly added to your PATH environment variable.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Issue: Permission denied or access errors during install">
**Solution:**
- Use a virtual environment to avoid permission issues.
- Or run pip with elevated privileges:

  ```bash
  sudo pip install morphik  # Linux/macOS
  ```
- Avoid using `sudo` when possible and prefer virtual environments.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Issue: Network connectivity or timeout errors">
**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection and firewall rules.
- Ensure your environment allows HTTPS traffic to PyPI.
- Retry installation after confirming connectivity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Issue: ImportError or module not found after install">
**Solution:**
- Verify you are running Python in the same environment where Morphik was installed.
- Check Python path and environment variables.
- Try reinstalling Morphik within your current environment.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Code Snippet

```python
import os
from morphik import Morphik

# Initialize Morphik client
morphik_uri = os.getenv("MORPHIK_URI")
db = Morphik(morphik_uri)

# Ingest a text document
text_doc = db.ingest_text(
    content="Verifying Morphik SDK installation",
    metadata={"test": "installation"}
)
print(f"Ingested document ID: {text_doc.external_id}")

# Perform a query
response = db.query("What is Morphik?", k=1)
