# Required Migrations and Updates

This guide walks you through a critical migration step required for users who installed Morphik **before June 22nd, 2025** to take advantage of faster authentication mechanisms introduced in recent updates. Follow the procedure below to run the migration script safely and verify that your system is updated correctly.

---

## Why This Migration is Necessary

If you installed Morphik prior to June 22, 2025, your installation uses an older authentication flow that can be slower and less efficient. This migration updates authentication-related database schemas and tokens to support faster, more secure authentication processes.

Skipping this migration will not immediately break your system but may impact authentication performance and compatibility with newer SDKs or the Morphik Console.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the migration, ensure the following:

- You have **administrator or write access** to the Morphik database.
- Your Morphik instance is **stopped or in maintenance mode** to avoid concurrent writes.
- You have access to the Morphik installation environment and command line.
- Your current Morphik version is indeed from before the cutoff date.

<Tip>
Run this migration **only once**. Running it multiple times is safe but unnecessary and may cause confusion.
</Tip>

---

## Step 1: Locate the Migration Script

The migration script is provided within the Morphik source repository under the `/migrations` directory named `auth_fast_path_migration.py`.

1. If you installed via Docker or pre-built packages, obtain the migration script from the Morphik GitHub repository:

```bash
curl -o auth_fast_path_migration.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morphik-org/morphik-core/main/migrations/auth_fast_path_migration.py
```

2. If you maintain the source directory locally, navigate to:

```
<your-morphik-dir>/migrations/auth_fast_path_migration.py
```


---

## Step 2: Backup Your Database

Before applying any migrations, **backup your database** to prevent data loss:

```bash
pg_dump -U <your_db_user> -h <your_db_host> -Fc morphik > morphik_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).dump
```

- Replace `<your_db_user>` and `<your_db_host>` with your actual credentials.
- This ensures you can restore your database if anything goes wrong.

<Warning>
Do not skip this step. Database migrations can modify authentication-related data critically.
</Warning>

---

## Step 3: Run the Migration Script

The migration script is a standalone Python executable. It requires your database connection environment variables or uses the existing Morphik configuration.

1. Ensure your environment variables for the database connection are set (e.g., `POSTGRES_URI`):

```bash
export POSTGRES_URI=postgresql+asyncpg://<user>:<password>@<host>:5432/morphik
```

2. Run the migration script:

```bash
python3 auth_fast_path_migration.py
```

3. The script will connect to your Morphik database and perform the necessary schema updates and token transformations.

4. If the script outputs success messages, migration is complete. If errors occur, review the error logs and confirm your database connection and permissions.

---

## Step 4: Verify Migration Success

Confirm the migration was successful by checking the following:

1. **Restart Morphik services** (API server, workers, and UI).

2. Run the following command to check Morphik's authentication status or perform a test login:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" https://<your-morphik-url>/ping
```

- If this returns HTTP 200 with a successful response, the authentication flow is working.

3. Optionally, inspect your database migration tables or Morphik logs for entries related to authentication migration.

4. Confirm in your Morphik Console or via the SDK that authentication is noticeably faster.

If you experience authentication errors or slowdowns, re-verify your migration steps, database backup status, and logs.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Migration Script Fails to Connect to Database">
- Verify your `POSTGRES_URI` and environment variables are correct.
- Confirm network accessibility to the database host.
- Check database user permissions.
- Review error logs printed during migration for more detail.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Migration Script Raises Permission Errors">
- Ensure the database user has sufficient permissions to modify authentication-related tables.
- Consider temporarily elevating privileges or using a superuser.
- Confirm Morphik services are not running to avoid conflicts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Authentication Fails After Migration">
- Double-check Morphik service restarts.
- Inspect the authentication logs for errors.
- Roll back to your database backup and retry migration carefully.
- Contact Morphik support if issues persist.

## Next Steps

- Continue with setting up or upgrading your Morphik SDK and Console to leverage the faster authentication.
- Review other migration or configuration update guides if your Morphik install is older.
- Consult the [Morphik System Requirements]( /getting-started/introduction-and-prerequisites/system-requirements) and [Basic Configuration]( /getting-started/install-configure-morphik/configuration-basics) for environment tuning.
- Explore workflow automation and advanced features that benefit from improved authentication performance.
