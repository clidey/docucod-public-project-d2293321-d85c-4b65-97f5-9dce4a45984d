# System Requirements & Prerequisites

To ensure a seamless experience with Morphik—whether you are using our hosted cloud service or opting for self-hosted deployment—you must meet specific system and software prerequisites. This page guides you through understanding these requirements and how to prepare your environment for Morphik.

---

## Supported Platforms

Morphik supports the following environments:

- **Cloud (Hosted Service):** No client-side install requirements apart from network connectivity.
- **Self-Hosted:** Compatible with Linux x86_64 (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended).

Morphik's primary developer tooling, including the Python SDK, supports macOS, Linux, and Windows for local client usage.

---

## Python Version Requirements

Morphik’s Python SDK and backend components require:

- **Python 3.8 or higher**

Ensure Python is installed properly and is accessible via your command line. You can verify your Python version by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If Python is older than 3.8, upgrade before proceeding.

---

## Required Packages and Dependencies

### For Morphik Python SDK

Install the Morphik Python client with:

```bash
pip install morphik
```

This will install the following dependencies automatically:

- `httpx` (for HTTP requests)
- `pyjwt` (for JWT token handling)
- `pydantic` (for data validation)
- `requests`
- `pillow` (for image processing)

### For Self-Hosted Deployments

When self-hosting Morphik, additional system packages are required:

- **Docker:** if using containerized installs
- **PostgreSQL:** for the backend database
- **Redis:** for caching
- **Python packages:** specified in the `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`, including the above dependencies and backend-specific libraries

Please refer to the [Self-Hosting Morphik (Docker & Direct Install)](/getting-started/install-configure-morphik/self-hosting-guide) page for detailed installation instructions.

---

## Hardware & Software Considerations for Self-Hosting

- **CPU:** Minimum 4 cores recommended for production deployments
- **RAM:** At least 8 GB available, 16 GB or more for heavy workloads
- **Disk Space:** Allocate minimum 10 GB free space for database and indices
- **Network:** Stable internet connection is needed for external API calls (e.g., cloud embeddings or LLM usage)
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS recommended for best compatibility and security updates

---

## Access & Credential Requirements for Hosted Cloud

To use Morphik’s hosted deployment:

- **Morphik Account:** Register at [https://www.morphik.ai/signup](https://www.morphik.ai/signup)
- **API Credentials:** You will receive an authentication token (JWT) when you sign up.
- **Network Access:** Your development environment must be able to reach `api.morphik.ai` on HTTPS (port 443).

You will use these credentials to authenticate via the Python SDK or REST API.

### Special Notes

- Ensure your firewall or corporate proxy does not block outbound HTTPS traffic to `api.morphik.ai`.
- You will need proper authorization scopes enabled on your account for ingesting and querying data.

---

## Network Requirements

Network configurations must allow traffic as below:

| Direction | Protocol | Port | Destination               | Purpose                         |
|-----------|----------|------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Outbound  | TCP      | 443  | `api.morphik.ai`          | API calls to Morphik Cloud      |
| Outbound  | TCP      | 5432 | Your PostgreSQL Server     | Self-hosted DB connectivity     |
| Outbound  | TCP      | 6379 | Redis Server               | Caching and message queue       |

When self-hosting on a private network, ensure that these ports are open and accessible within your environment.

---

## Summary Checklist

Before proceeding with Morphik installation or usage, confirm the following:

- [ ] Running Python 3.8 or higher
- [ ] Morphik Python SDK installed via `pip`
- [ ] For self-hosting, Docker, PostgreSQL, and Redis installed and configured
- [ ] Morphik account created for cloud usage with API token obtained
- [ ] Network allows outbound HTTPS to `api.morphik.ai`
- [ ] Hardware meets minimum CPU, RAM, and disk recommendations (especially for self-hosted environments)

---

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<Tip>
**Python Version Check:** If `python3 --version` returns a version below 3.8, install or upgrade Python.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Dependency Installation Errors:** Try updating `pip` with `pip install --upgrade pip` before installing Morphik SDK.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If you are behind a proxy, configure your shell environment variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`) to allow Python and `pip` to reach external URLs.
</Warning>

<Note>
For self-hosted installations, follow the exact steps in the Self-Hosting guide to ensure all system dependencies match the backend requirements.
</Note>

## Next Steps

- Proceed to the [Signing Up for Morphik (Hosted Service)](/getting-started/install-configure-morphik/cloud-signup) guide if you want to use the hosted service.
- For self-hosting, follow the complete instructions at [Self-Hosting Morphik (Docker & Direct Install)](/getting-started/install-configure-morphik/self-hosting-guide).
- Once installed and configured, test your setup using the [Validating Your Morphik Setup](/getting-started/first-steps-and-validation/validation-and-health-checks) page.
