# Building a Knowledge Graph from Documents

Transform your raw data into actionable graphs. This walkthrough explains how to generate a domain-specific knowledge graph from ingested documents using SDK tools, battle-tested prompts, and customization options.

---

## 1. Understanding Knowledge Graphs in Morphik

A knowledge graph organizes information as interconnected entities and relationships extracted from your documents. Instead of searching isolated text segments, a knowledge graph provides a rich semantic structure
that captures how concepts relate in your domain.

**Why build a knowledge graph from documents?**

- Unlock deep insights by linking key concepts extracted from your content.
- Enhance search and question answering using graph-based context.
- Integrate complex domain knowledge into your AI workflows.

This page focuses specifically on creating the knowledge graph, highlighting SDK functions, workflows, and customization options.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before following this guide, you should have:

- A Morphik account and access to the Morphik Python SDK (see the [SDK Installation guide](../sdks/getting-started/install-sdk))
- One or more documents ingested into Morphik (text or files) that contain the domain information you want to extract
- Basic familiarity with Python and asynchronous programming if using the AsyncMorphik client

If you havenâ€™t ingested documents yet, please see the guide on [Ingesting Documents of All Types](/guides/core-workflows/ingest-documents).

---

## 3. Workflow Overview: Creating a Knowledge Graph

This workflow walks you through how to create a domain-specific knowledge graph from your existing documents using the Morphik Python SDK.

### Expected Outcome

- You will produce a named knowledge graph object containing extracted entities and relationships
- This graph will be queryable and usable to enrich semantic search and completion tasks

### Time Estimate

15-30 minutes to complete, depending on document volume

### Difficulty

Intermediate - requires some familiarity with the SDK and asynchronous API calls

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Document Filters or IDs

You can create a graph from all documents matching specific metadata filters or by specifying explicit document IDs.

```python
filters = {"category": "tech"}  # Example filter on ingested document metadata
# or, list of specific document IDs
documents = ["doc_123", "doc_456"]
```


### Step 2: Optional - Customize Entity Extraction with Prompt Overrides

Morphik allows you to provide prompt override objects to tailor how entities and relationships are extracted from your documents.

Example of providing custom entity extraction examples:

```python
from morphik.models import EntityExtractionExample, EntityExtractionPromptOverride, GraphPromptOverrides

examples = [
    EntityExtractionExample(label="Insulin", type="MEDICATION"),
    EntityExtractionExample(label="Diabetes", type="CONDITION"),
]
entity_extraction_override = EntityExtractionPromptOverride(examples=examples)
graph_overrides = GraphPromptOverrides(entity_extraction=entity_extraction_override)
```

This step enhances extraction accuracy by showing the model sample entities relevant to your domain.


### Step 3: Creating the Graph with the AsyncMorphik Client

Use the `create_graph` method on an `AsyncFolder` or `AsyncUserScope` or directly on `AsyncMorphik` to create the graph.

Example creating from filters:

```python
from morphik.async_ import AsyncMorphik

async with AsyncMorphik("morphik://owner_id:token@api.morphik.ai") as db:
    graph = await db.create_graph(
        name="tech_healthcare_graph",
        filters={"category": "tech"},
        prompt_overrides=graph_overrides  # optional
    )

    print(f"Created graph: {graph.name} with {len(graph.entities)} entities")
```

Example creating from document IDs:

```python
graph = await db.create_graph(name="custom_graph", documents=["doc_1", "doc_2"])
```


### Step 4: Wait for Graph Processing to Complete

Graph creation may be asynchronous depending on your deployment. Use `wait_for_graph_completion` to block until ready:

```python
completed_graph = await db.wait_for_graph_completion(graph.name)
print(f"Graph is ready: {completed_graph.name}")
```


### Step 5: Query and Explore Your Graph

Once created, you can query your knowledge graph using the `query` method with the `graph_name` parameter. For example:

```python
response = await db.query(
    "How is AI technology being used in healthcare?",
    graph_name="tech_healthcare_graph",
    hop_depth=2  # Explore relationships up to 2 hops away
)
print(response.completion)
```

Include relationship paths in the response by setting `include_paths=True`:

```python
response_paths = await db.query(
    "What technologies analyze electronic health records?",
    graph_name="tech_healthcare_graph",
    hop_depth=2,
    include_paths=True
)

for path in response_paths.metadata["graph"]["paths"]:
    print(" -> ".join(path))
```


### Step 6: (Optional) Update Your Graph with New Documents

If new documents become available, you can update an existing graph:

```python
updated_graph = await db.update_graph(
    name="tech_healthcare_graph",
    additional_filters={"category": "new_tech"},
    additional_documents=["doc_789"]
)

print(f"Graph updated with {len(updated_graph.entities)} entities")
```


---

## 5. Practical Example

Here is a simplified synchronous example (for conceptual clarity - async is recommended for production):

```python
from morphik import Morphik

db = Morphik("morphik://owner_id:token@api.morphik.ai")

# Create a knowledge graph from all documents tagged with 'tech'
graph = db.create_graph(name="tech_graph", filters={"category": "tech"})

print(f"Graph created: {graph.name}")

# Query the graph
response = db.query(
    "How does AI impact cloud computing?",
    graph_name="tech_graph",
    hop_depth=2
)

print(response.completion)
```

## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- **Use Filters Thoughtfully:** Narrow down which documents feed into your graph to improve relevance.

- **Prompt Overrides:** Use domain-specific examples in overrides to improve entity/relationship extraction precision.

- **Naming:** Give your graph a clear, descriptive name for easy identification.

- **Hop Depth:** Set the `hop_depth` in queries to control the depth of explored relationships (1-3 recommended).

- **Wait for Completion:** Always use `wait_for_graph_completion()` for asynchronous graph builds to ensure you query fully built graphs.

- **Async Usage:** Prefer async SDK methods for responsive applications and to avoid blocking.

- **Update Incrementally:** Use `update_graph` to add documents without rebuilding the entire graph.

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues When Building Knowledge Graphs">
<Accordion title="No graphs found or graph creation fails">
Ensure you have ingested documents before creating a graph. Check your authentication and folder scoping if applicable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Graph creation appears blocked or hangs">
Use `wait_for_graph_completion()` with a timeout to monitor progress. Check server logs for errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Queries return no answers or empty results">
Verify your graph is built and contains entities. Increase `hop_depth` or check filters on documents.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Custom prompt overrides not working as expected">
Review prompt override syntax and example formatting. Start with simple overrides and test incrementally.

## 9. Reference: Key AsyncMorphik Methods for Building Graphs

```python
async def create_graph(
    name: str,
    filters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    documents: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    prompt_overrides: Optional[Union[GraphPromptOverrides, Dict[str, Any]]] = None
) -> Graph
```
Create a knowledge graph from documents filtered by metadata or specific document IDs. Optional prompt overrides customize extraction.

```python
async def wait_for_graph_completion(
    graph_name: str,
    timeout_seconds: int = 300,
    check_interval_seconds: int = 2
) -> Graph
```
Poll the graph status and wait until complete, raising a timeout error if not ready.

```python
async def update_graph(
    name: str,
    additional_filters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    additional_documents: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    prompt_overrides: Optional[Union[GraphPromptOverrides, Dict[str, Any]]] = None
) -> Graph
```
Add new documents to an existing graph with optional filters and prompt overrides.

```python
async def query(
    query: str,
    graph_name: Optional[str] = None,
    hop_depth: int = 1,
    include_paths: bool = False
) -> CompletionResponse
```
Query the knowledge graph with optional depth and path inclusion.
```

            filters={"category": "medical"},
            prompt_overrides=graph_overrides
        )

        print(f"Created graph '{graph.name}' with {len(graph.entities)} entities")

        # Wait until the graph is fully processed
        graph_ready = await db.wait_for_graph_completion(graph.name)
        print(f"Graph status: {graph_ready.system_metadata.get('status')}")

# Run the async function
import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```
