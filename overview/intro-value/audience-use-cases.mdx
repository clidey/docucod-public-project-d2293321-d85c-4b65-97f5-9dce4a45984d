## Target Users and Their Needs

### 1. Developers Building AI-Powered Document Applications

If you're a developer tasked with creating AI solutions that must ingest, search, and query complex documents—ranging from PDFs, scanned images, and multimedia files to richly formatted reports—Morphik provides the tools you need:

- **Simplified multimodal ingestion:** Easily ingest mixed text and images with a single API or SDK call.
- **Semantic search with visual understanding:** Search documents by meaning, not just keywords, including images and diagrams.
- **Knowledge graph creation:** Automatically extract entities and relationships to build searchable, explorable knowledge graphs.

**Example Scenario:**

> Building a customer support tool that can ingest product manuals (with diagrams) and user guides and answer natural language queries accurately, even about visual content like assembly instructions or product schematics.

### 2. Data Scientists Handling Visual and Multimodal Data

For data scientists who process large volumes of heterogeneous data, often containing both textual and visual elements, Morphik offers:

- **Advanced metadata extraction:** Pull structured information from documents using customizable extraction rules.
- **Entity and relationship extraction:** Identify relevant entities like people, places, dates, and their connections across your data.
- **Flexible querying:** Perform semantic queries over text and images to uncover insights that traditional text-only tools miss.

**Example Scenario:**

> Analyzing research papers with embedded charts and tables to discover key findings and trends where visual context is critical for accurate interpretation.

### 3. Product Teams Seeking Better Context Understanding

Morphik helps product managers, content strategists, and knowledge workers by delivering:

- **Unified content search:** Find relevant info across fragmented data silos without losing context.
- **Collaboration enablement:** Integrate with platforms like Slack, Google Suite, or Confluence to bring AI insights into familiar workflows.
- **Persistent knowledge:** Use cache-augmented generation to provide fast, relevant answers powered by your own data.

**Example Scenario:**

> A product team centralizes all project documentation and user feedback in Morphik, enabling fast semantic search and question answering that reduces time-to-insight and improves decision-making.

## Practical Examples Illustrating Morphik’s Ideal Applications

### Example 1: AI-Powered Technical Support

A development team builds an AI assistant that ingests complex technical manuals, user feedback reports, and design diagrams. Thanks to Morphik’s multimodal search capabilities, the assistant answers detailed user queries referencing both text instructions and visual diagrams, leading to faster issue resolution.

### Example 2: Research Data Analysis

Data scientists ingest research documents with tables, pictures, and graphs. Morphik extracts structured metadata and builds a knowledge graph to detect relationships between concepts. This graph enables rich queries that uncover hidden connections.

### Example 3: Enterprise Document Management

A product team manages thousands of internal documents across departments. By organizing documents into folders scoped to projects and users, Morphik ensures relevant, contextual search results and supports intelligent summaries that improve productivity.
