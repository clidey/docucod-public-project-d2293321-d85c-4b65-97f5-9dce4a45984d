# Console, Python SDK & API Options

Explore the three primary ways to interact with Morphik — via the **Morphik Console**, the **Python SDK**, and the **REST API**. Each method caters to different user preferences and workflows, from ad-hoc explorations and manual document uploads to programmatic, large-scale ingestion and integration scenarios.

---

## Why Choosing the Right Interface Matters

Imagine you are a developer aiming to harness powerful AI-driven insights from complex documents. You want to store, search, and query diverse data effortlessly. Morphik provides the flexibility for you to engage at your comfort level — whether you prefer an intuitive web interface, seamless Python code integration, or direct API calls for full automation.

Understanding each option empowers you to scale your solution efficiently, moving from experimentation to production-ready workflows without friction.

## Morphik Console: Intuitive Web Interface for Rapid Interaction

The **Morphik Console** is your web-based control center for all Morphik operations. It offers a user-friendly graphical interface to:
- Upload documents manually (PDFs, images, text files, videos, and more).
- Manage folders and organize your data visually.
- Conduct semantic searches and interact via chat-style queries.
- View ingestion status and metadata without coding.

### User Flow Example:
1. Log in to the Console.
2. Upload your documents via drag-and-drop or file selector.
3. Wait briefly while Morphik processes and indexes your data.
4. Search or chat with your documents to extract insights.

### When to Use the Console
- When you prefer no-code or low-code interaction.
- For quick experiments with small datasets.
- Collaborating in teams without programming overhead.
- Monitoring and managing data ingestion status visually.

<Callout>
**Tip:** The Console is the perfect starting point to familiarize yourself with your data in Morphik before automating ingestion using SDK or API.
</Callout>

## Python SDK: Seamless, Developer-Friendly Integration

Morphik’s **Python SDK** offers a powerful yet simple client library for programmatic access to all Morphik features, including document ingestion, retrieval, and query.

### Key Capabilities
- Ingest text documents or files directly from your Python applications.
- Create and manage folders and user scopes programmatically.
- Perform semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) queries.
- Batch processing with parallel ingestion support.
- Both synchronous and asynchronous clients available for your preferred coding style.

### Example: Ingesting and Querying Documents
```python
from morphik import Morphik

# Initialize Morphik client (default localhost:8000 or your endpoint URI)
db = Morphik()

# Ingest a text document
doc = db.ingest_text(
    content="Morphik is an AI-native platform for multimodal document understanding.",
    filename="intro.txt",
    metadata={"category": "example"}
)
print(f"Document ID: {doc.external_id}")

# Query the ingested data
response = db.query("What is Morphik used for?", filters={"category": "example"})
print("Query result:", response.completion)
```

### Asynchronous Usage
The SDK also supports async programming for high-throughput or I/O-bound applications:

```python
import asyncio
from morphik.async_ import AsyncMorphik

async def main():
    async with AsyncMorphik() as db:
        doc = await db.ingest_text(content="Async ingestion example", filename="async.txt")
        response = await db.query("Summarize async client")
        print(response.completion)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### When to Use the Python SDK
- Integrate Morphik into your Python apps and workflows.
- Automate ingestion and querying in pipelines.
- Utilize both sync and async paradigms depending on your architecture.
- Leverage advanced features like folder and user scoping.

<Callout>
**Best Practice:** Use the SDK to batch process large datasets and leverage parallel ingestion capabilities for efficiency.
</Callout>

## REST API: Flexible Programmatic Access for Any Environment

For full control and language-independent integration, Morphik exposes a well-documented **REST API**. This API enables:
- Document ingestion by uploading files or text payloads.
- Managing resources such as folders and user scopes.
- Performing semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation queries.

### Use Cases
- Integrating Morphik with services or platforms where Python SDK is not available.
- Building custom clients in any programming language.
- Embedding Morphik functionalities into backend services, web apps, or automation scripts.

### Example: Simple REST API Request to Ingest a Document
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.morphik.ai/documents/ingest" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/document.pdf" \
  -F "metadata={\"category\":\"reports\"}" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
```

### When to Use the REST API
- When working outside of Python environments.
- For building custom integrations tailored to your infrastructure.
- For scenarios requiring fine-grained HTTP request control.

<Note>
Morphik SDK internally uses this API; therefore, all SDK features are available through the REST endpoints.

## Choosing the Right Interaction Method

| Interface       | Best For                                        | Strengths                             |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Morphik Console | Manual uploads and exploration                  | Intuitive UI, quick insights         |
| Python SDK      | Application integration, automation             | Developer-friendly, sync & async     |
| REST API        | Language-agnostic, custom client construction   | Maximum flexibility, direct control  |
