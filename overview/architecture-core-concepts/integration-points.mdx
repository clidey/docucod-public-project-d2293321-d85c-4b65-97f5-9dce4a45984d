```

This flow illustrates how external apps push or pull data through Morphik’s API or SDK. Data is ingested, transformed, and stored in optimized structures enabling advanced capabilities like semantic search and graph analytics. The outputs of these engines can be consumed back through the API or embedded workflows.

## Using the REST API & Python SDK

### REST API

The Morphik REST API provides endpoints to:

- Ingest files and metadata
- Query documents with semantic search
- Build and query knowledge graphs
- Extract structured metadata

**Example: Ingest a Document via REST API**

```http
POST /api/documents
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer <token>

(file attached as multipart payload)
```

**Example: Semantic Search Query**

```http
POST /api/search
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "query": "Find safety procedures for equipment XYZ",
  "filters": {"department": "manufacturing"},
  "top_k": 5
}
```

### Python SDK

Use the Python SDK for seamless interaction, including: ingestion, querying, and graph management.

```python
from morphik import Morphik

morphik = Morphik("<your-morphik-uri>")

# Ingest a file
morphik.ingest_file("manuals/equipment_xyz.pdf")

# Query documents
results = morphik.query("Safety procedures for equipment XYZ", k=3)
print(results)

# Build a knowledge graph
graph = morphik.create_graph(name="equipment_safety")

# Run a graph query
response = morphik.query_graph("list_entities", start_nodes=["safety"], max_depth=2)
print(response)
```

## Best Practices for Integrations

- **Authentication & Security:** Use OAuth securely for Google Suite and Slack connectors. Always manage API tokens safely for direct API/SDK access.
- **Scoping Data:** Utilize folder names, user IDs, or metadata filters to restrict data ingestion and queries to relevant subsets.
- **Performance:** For large-scale workflows, combine batch ingestion with asynchronous SDK operations. Cache frequent queries at your application layer.
- **Metadata Extraction:** Leverage rules-driven extraction as part of ingestion to automatically enrich documents with structured metadata that enhances integration relevancy.
- **Workflow Automation:** Use Morphik workflows triggered by new ingestions or API calls to automate repetitive processing tasks.

<Tip>
When integrating with corporate SaaS platforms, ensure you monitor API rate limits and error responses to maintain reliability.

## Common Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Integration Troubleshooting Guidelines">
<Accordion title="Authentication Failures">
Check your OAuth client setup or API keys. Ensure token scopes match the API requirements (e.g., read-only Drive access). Verify tokens have not expired or revoked.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Data Doesn't Appear in Morphik Queries">
Confirm ingestion success via logs or API responses. Verify metadata and folder scoping filters. Double-check document formats and supported file types.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Slow Query Performance">
Use filters and restrict query scope. Enable caching for frequently executed queries. Use the SDK's async capabilities to parallelize operations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="API Rate Limits or Errors from External Services">
Implement exponential backoff on retries. Monitor rate limits carefully. Contact service providers for higher quotas if needed.
